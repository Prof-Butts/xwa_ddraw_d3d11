0x0

The first line is a bitmask in hex format that specifies which cockpit
instruments will be enabled. The rest of the lines are simply ignored. Try the
following masks and press Ctrl+C to apply them:

0x01FFF: All cockpit instruments are enabled.
0x01FFE: Disable the CMD
0x01FF1: Disable Laser/Ion energy levels.
0x01FEF: Disable the beam weapon.
0x01FDF: Disable the Shields.
0x01FBF: Disable the throttle display.
0x01E7F: Disable Sensors.
0x01DFF: Disable Laser recharge rate.
0x01BFF: Disable Engine Power.
0x017FF: Disable Shields recharge rate.
0x00FFF: Disable the beam recharge rate.

Since this is a bitmask, multiple instruments can be enabled or disabled at the
same time by combining their masks. That's why a value of 0x0 disables
everything. A value of 0x01FF0 will disable both the CMD and the laser/ion
energy levels, etc.

Pressing Ctrl+Shift+C removes any damage applied to the cockpit.
